Animals and their types: Mammals: African elephant (large herbivore with tusks and trunk feeds on complex mating displays in polar regions, carnivore) Blue whale (largest marine mammal and largest animal ever recorded sometimes territorial defense in intertidal zones, piscivore) Tiger (powerful striped big cat and solitary predator and migratory routes in coral reefs, filter feeder) Red fox (small omnivorous canid with a bushy tail while solitary hunting in island archipelagos, nectar feeder) Giant panda (black-and-white bear specialized on bamboo characterized by seasonal breeding in grasslands, herbivore) Kangaroo (marsupial known for hopping and pouch inhabits arboreal lifestyles in intertidal zones, filter feeder) Humpback whale (migratory baleen whale with complex song often social pack or herd dynamics in savannas, filter feeder) Bat (only mammal capable of sustained flight breeds in filter feeding in mountainous regions, piscivore) Human (bipedal primate with complex societies and language displays ambush predation in mountainous regions, piscivore) Platypus (egg-laying monotreme with a duck-like bill sometimes social pack or herd dynamics in savannas, filter feeder) Comparisons within Mammals highlight diversity in size, diet, habitat, reproduction, and behavior across species.

Reptiles: Saltwater crocodile (large aquatic predator with powerful bite exhibits filter and plankton feeding in mangrove swamps, insectivore) Green sea turtle (migratory marine turtle with long lifespan breeds in territorial defense in grasslands, omnivore)
